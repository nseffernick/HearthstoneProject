Idea - Create a program that will simulate hundreds of matches really quicky, where users insert decks to play against each other.
The application of this would be for players to understand how the decks they bring into ranked will fare against the ladder (chaos).

Example Use: A User is trying to decide which deck to craft. It is very important that he spends his dust wisely because he is a Free to Play player (btw) and wasting dust results in wasting many hours playing. He selects his favored deck and presses 'auto-sim' which will simulate his deck playing every deck on  

Example Use: A User is facing a lot of Pirate Warrior, some Quest Warrior, some Quest Priest and little to none of anything else with his home brewed Beast Hunter deck.
The user simulates his deck against these 3 matchups with 70% chance to play Pirate Warrior 20% chance to play Quest Warrior and 10% quest priest, and simulates 500 games.
Within minutes he receives his overall win rate, and detailed descriptions of the matches, cards most often played, when the game is lost/won, other valuable statistics and info.
Furthermore this user can tweak his deck slightly and just move a couple cards in/out and go back in the sim.

No idea if or when this will be done, mostly done for personal project.
Don't steal without asking please. :)
